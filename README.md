# Pyro-Test-Board
An analog, high-current pyrotechnic driver for evaluating high power rocketry igniters

This board is intended to evaluate igniters and other pyrotechnic devices used in high-power rocketry for safe parachute ejection. It uses closed-loop analog current control to drive a set current through a device of varying resistance while allowing for external measurements of the test device's performance. It is intended for benchtop use with a 3S or 4S LiPo battery, or a benchtop power supply.
